# About Me ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! ðŸ˜„ My name is Juliana Eko, and <ins>I'm a UI/UX design and Front End Development enthusiast!</ins> 

Just recently, I completed the Web and Mobile Design-UI/UX course developed by Zero To Mastery Academy. This has been really helpful as **I am currently working on the user interface design for a database/quiz website**. Additionally, I am proficient in HTML and CSS, and I am building my competence in front end designs using the React.js library.

 I'm looking to collaborate on web and mobile app development project to build a larger portfolio. I am also very much open to contributing to open-source projects! I love creating functional and efficient codes. I'm a big proponent of putting an emphasis on accessibility.

I'm always looking to work on interesting projects, so shoot me an **e-mail (ekoojuliana@gmail.com)** if you've got interesting projects!
